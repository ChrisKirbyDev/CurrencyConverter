# Currency Converter

I started this project to provide myself with an introduction to Typescript and to the Angular Framework. I was attracted to these technologies because;

- TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug.
- TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand.
- TypeScript is still JavaScript but with additional features like Modules Support.
- Angular supports Single Page Applications.
- Angular offers modularity, which is great for large projects so the code can be kept clean and organized!
- Angular uses HTML for defining the user interface of an application.
